## Overview

My research explores the interplay between domestic and international politics, seeking to understand, first, when and why foreign affairs becomes salient in the national dialogue, and, second, the ways in which the political climate at home affects state behavior on the international stage. With a substantive focus on East Asia, my dissertation examines first, when and where states strategically pursue aggressive foreign policy for domestic ends, leveraging interstate rivalry to amplify perceptions of foreign threat and rile anti-foreign nationalism, and second, how citizens respond in ways that affect larger political landscapes both home and abroad. 

Additionally, I am also interested in political methodology and in separate projects explore applications of LLMs in political research, reducing user-specification sensitivity in survey weighting, and causal inference approaches to observational data broadly speaking.

### Convenient Rivals: Executive Appeals to Historical Memory in Nationalist Standoffs


While a vast literature in international relations has examined the drivers of recurrent patterns of international conflict between pairs of rival states, less attention has focused on how a history of bilateral contest shapes relations in more peaceful times. Moreover, while many rivalries center elite-level geopolitical competition, certain dyads additionally foment mutual distrust, resentment, and animosity between their domestic publics. I focus on just these sociocultural rivalries, exploring how rivalry which encompasses not only geopolitical competition, but also a deeply rooted sociocultural antagonism affects relations between states, particularly outside the narrow context of rarely occurring overt conflict. Specifically, I ask: when and where do leaders invoke histories of international rivalry to emphasize foreign threats and disrupt bilateral relations? 

Building upon a large literature on diversionary war, I find that executives often strategically exploit aggressive foreign policy against such rivals far short of outright war in an effort to consolidate political support in times of severe domestic insecurity. In so doing, they exploit the psychology of out-group threat to unite the public in opposition to a foreign adversary and divert attention away from controversies at home. In particular, vulnerable leaders draw upon historical memory of prior suffering at the hands of a foreign foe in a set of historical disputes centering goods of high nationalistic value.

Drawing on a large, cross-disciplinary literature on collective memory and national identity, I contend that these historical disputes have out-sized symbolic and nationalistic value relative to their material worth due to their direct connection to prior collective suffering. In these disputes, foreign behavior is cast as a direct challenge to core territory, symbols, or events central to narratives which structure national identity, generating strong threat perceptions and riling fervent, anti-foreign nationalism well before tensions become militarized. Consequently, I expect vulnerable leaders to take aggressive, uncompromising postures in historical disputes against long-time rivals through rhetorical, diplomatic, or economic means which generate patriotic “rally-round-the-flag” boosts in public approval with minimal risk of escalation into costly outright conflict. Further, I argue that foreign policy reputation plays an important mediating role in the choice to initiate versus escalate disputes. Finally, I assert that while territorial issues are especially effective in riling strong domestic reactions, they come at higher cost of risky escalation into overt conflict. I therefore expect executives to re-aggravate dormant territorial disputes only when facing an especially severe degree of political vulnerability.


To evaluate this argument, I examine relations in East Asia where regional rivalries are fueled by enduring historical animosity and popular understandings of both Chinese and South Korean identity are structured around narratives of collective suffering under Imperial Japan. I first conduct a series of close case studies examining how various leaders highlight or downplay their bilateral historical disputes in accordance with their domestic political vulnerability. Next, I collect and analyze a large-volume of public facing executive rhetoric regarding foreign affairs. Using these data, I evaluate whether heightened political insecurity corresponds to increased attention and hostility toward rivals, particularly in long-running historical disputes. Finally, I evaluate whether there is causal, micro-level evidence of the central psychological mechanism at work among average citizens using a survey experiment in South Korea and China.

## Dissertation Abstract

I examine first, when and where states strategically pursue aggressive foreign policy that falls short of militarized conflict, and second, how citizens respond in ways that affect larger political landscapes both home and abroad. I argue that in times of acute internal political insecurity, leaders exploit their informational advantage and agenda setting power over foreign affairs to strategically draw focus toward international tensions. In so doing, they exploit the psychology of out-group threat to unite the public in opposition to a foreign adversary and divert attention away from domestic controversies. I posit that disputes tapping into historical rivalries and framing foreign behavior as a violation of national sovereignty, identity, or pride rile strong nationalistic sentiment making them uniquely effective in bolstering regime support. I therefore expect vulnerable leaders to highlight aggression in nationalistic disputes against long-time rivals. To test this theory, I track elite rhetoric in South Korea, China and Japan, examining when specific foreign policy issues gain salience domestically and the link between hostile foreign policy and domestic insecurity. Next, I seek causal, micro-level evidence of the underlying psychological mechanism, examining how average citizens respond to assertive foreign policy in an online survey experiment in China and South Korea. -->

In the wake of numerous corruption scandals within his administration and party, President Kim Yong Sam televises his phone call to South Korean police on Dokdo Island announcing the building of a new Warf on the disputed island in the weeks directly preceding the 1996 Legislative Elections. This sparks strong complaints from the Japanese side leading to the breakdown of diplomatic relations.
