## Research

My research explores the interplay between domestic and international politics, seeking to understand, first, when and why foreign affairs becomes salient in the national dialogue, and, second, the ways in which the political climate at home affects state behavior on the international stage. With a substantive focus on East Asia, my dissertation examines first, when and where states strategically pursue aggressive foreign policy for domestic ends, leveraging interstate rivalry to amplify perceptions of foreign threat and rile anti-foreign nationalism, and second, how citizens respond in ways that affect larger political landscapes both home and abroad. 

Additionally, I am also interested in political methodology and in separate projects explore applications of LLMs in political research, reducing user-specification sensitivity in survey weighting and causal inference approaches to observational data broadly speaking. 

## Teaching

At UCLA, I have twice taught a specialized upper-division seminar "Politics of East Asia: Unique Puzzles in International Relations" as well as our department's required statistics class for all majors "Introduction to Data Analysis." As a TA, I have also taught in Introduction to IR, as well as in graduate-level methodology courses including MLE, Causal Inference, and Experimental Design. I have also served as our department "Math Maven" assisting fellow graduate students on any problems related to methodology in their research or coursework for several years and additionally taught the "Math Camp" review crash course for incoming first year graduate students.
