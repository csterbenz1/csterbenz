## Research

My research explores the domestic drivers of aggressive foreign policy, paying particular attention to executive appeals to nationalism and historical memory centering international rivalry. I focus inquiry on East Asia primarily among Japan, South Korea, and China. Additionally, I am also interested in political methodology and in separate projects explore applications of LLMs in political research, reducing user-specification sensitivity in survey weighting and causal inference approaches to observational data broadly speaking. 

## Teaching

At UCLA, I have twice taught a specialized upper-division seminar "Politics of East Asia: Unique Puzzles in International Relations" as well as our department's required statistics class for all majors "Introduction to Data Analysis." As a TA, I have also taught in Introduction to IR, as well as in graduate-level methodology courses including MLE, Causal Inference, and Experimental Design. I have also served as our department "Math Maven" assisting fellow graduate students on any problems related to methodology in their research or coursework for several years and additionally taught the "Math Camp" review crash course for incoming first year graduate students.
